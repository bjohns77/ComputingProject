         <p>The following graphs investigate the correlation between age and the likelihood of arrest or being a crime victim. The first two graphs detail crime victims and arrests separately, while the third graph is a visual comparison of the crime victims and arrests graphs.  </p>

         <p><b>First Insight: </b> There are more crime victims than arrested individuals at every age.</p>
         <p><b>Second Insight: </b> The most likely age to be arrested is 29, and the most likely age to be a crime victim at is 30. </p>
         <p><b>Third Insight: </b> The linear increase in arrests from 10 to 29 is much steeper than the linear decrease in arrests from 29 to around 74. This correlates with a great surge in arrests as children grow into young adults, but a slower decline in arrests as people age out of young adulthood into their middle ages.  </p>
         <p><b>Fourth Insight: </b> Likewise, the linear increase in crime victims from 10 to 30 is much steeper than the linear decrease from 30 to around 78. This suggests that young adults are seen as more vulnerable targets of crime.</p>
         <p><b>Fifth Insight: </b> The number of arrests flattens out to a linear line near 0 at age 75, whereas the number of crime victims does not flatten out to a linear line near 0 until age 88. Therefore, old people are more likely to be crime victims than they are to be arrested for committing a crime. This could indicate that criminals take advantage of the elderly population.   </p>
         <p><b>Sixth Insight: </b> There is a surprising number of young individuals arrested. This can be attributed to the fact that young children taken into custody due to inadequate adult caregivers are included in the count of arrested individuals.  </p>
         <p><b>Seventh Insight: </b> There is a very slight deviation from the negative linear trend in crime victims and arrests around age 53. Around age 50, both graphs flatten out slightly, indicating that individuals in their early 50s are not significantly less likely to be victims or arrested than those in their late 50s. </p>
         <p><b>Eighth Insight: </b> Age 35 and age 50 have an uncharacteristically high number of crime victims relative to the number of crime victims of surrounding ages. </p>
         <p><b>Ninth Insight: </b> Individuals are more likely to be subject to arrest or victim of a crime at a very young age than at a very old age. </p>
         <p><b>Tenth Insight: </b> There is a large increase in the number of crime victims between the ages of 18 to 23 (an increase of about 10.5k). After 18, the probability that an individual is a victim of a crime increases greatly. </p>
