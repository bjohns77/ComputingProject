         <p><b>First Insight:</b> The most common crime was stolen vehicles.</p>
         <p><b>Second Insight:</b> There was one account of the crime "train wrecking".</p>
         <p><b>Third Insight:</b> There were more cases of identity theft than assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
         <p><b>Fourth Insight:</b> There were 300 more instances of stalking than of attempted rape, both of which are "red dot" activities.</p>
         <p><b>Fifth Insight:</b> There are multiple types of crimes for theft from a motor vehicle, which could be attributed to the severity of the crime.</p>

         <p><b>First Insight:</b> More people were arrested for felonies than misdemeanors.</p>
         <p><b>Second Insight:</b> About 20,000 people were arrested for infractions, which is the least serious offence.</p>
         <p><b>Third Insight:</b> The least amount of arrests made were dependent arrests.</p>
         <p><b>Fourth Insight:</b> The most amount of arrests made were felonies, which aligns with common sense, as those are the most serious crimes committed.</p>
         <p><b>Fifth Insight:</b> There is a category of other, which is interesting because that means that some arrests do not fall into the category of misdemeanor or felony, so it could be a combination of the two.</p>

         <p><b>First Insight:</b> People were most frequently arrested for miscellaneous other violations. </p>
         <p><b>Second Insight:</b> Only about 1200 people were arrested for homicide, </p>
         <p><b>Third Insight:</b> 14,000 people were arrested for vehicle theft, which is interesting because the largest category of crimes committed was stolen vehicles.</p>
         <p><b>Fourth Insight:</b> More people were arrested for robbery than burglary.</p>
         <p><b>Fifth Insight:</b> There is a category for non-criminal detention, which could mean that people were brought in for questioning or taken from the custody of their parents. </p>
